# ib_insync_XL
Excel front-end for ib_insync

Note that:
- All code is written on Macos, due to which some xlWings functionality such as UDFs is not available
- Excel tables ('Portfolio', 'Open New Positions' and 'Close Positions') are setup in a specific format
- For now, the setup works for Stocks and Options only
